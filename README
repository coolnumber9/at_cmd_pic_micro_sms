This is the source code (PIC Assembly) of our design project during college (2004) entitled "Microcontroller-based Home Control and Security System via SMS". This serves as my first github repo and the main purpose is to share the code as well as familiarize myself with git and github.

All information related to the project are transferred to the WIKI page.
